## 🧩 Problem Statement

AtliQ operates across multiple regions, markets, products, and customers, generating large volumes of transactional and forecast data.
Leadership teams require **clear, consistent, and reliable insights** to monitor **sales performance, profitability, forecast accuracy, and operational risks** across the organization.

However, decision-makers often face challenges such as:

* Fragmented data across departments
* Difficulty comparing actual performance vs targets
* Limited visibility into profitability drivers and demand risks

The objective is to build a **centralized Business Intelligence solution** that consolidates data from multiple domains into a **single, executive-ready analytics platform**.

## 🧭 Key Insights

* The business generates approximately **$3.74B in Net Sales**, with a **Gross Margin of ~38%**, indicating strong top-line performance but margin pressure at the net profit level.

* **Net Profit stands at -13.98%**, highlighting high operating and logistics costs that significantly impact profitability despite strong revenue.

* **Forecast Accuracy averages ~81%**, but certain customers and products contribute disproportionately to **net error and stock imbalance**, increasing inventory risk.

* **APAC and North America** contribute the highest sales volumes, while some regions generate strong revenue with comparatively lower margins, signaling pricing and cost optimization opportunities.

* A small subset of **top customers and products** drives a large share of revenue, increasing dependency risk and reinforcing the need for portfolio diversification.
